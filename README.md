Simple Contacts App for Favorite Medium's Exam.

## Tech

### Angular

There's no real-world advantage in writing this examination in AngularJS (1.x) since it's a legacy library now. I used Angular (2+) because it's fun to write with, especially Typescript; easy to setup; the **_componenterization_** (made up word) is great; and it's actively maintained.

### Angular Material

Material Design is fast, optimized for Angular, great set of components, and modern-looking.

## Building

```bash
$ yarn install
$ ng serve
```
